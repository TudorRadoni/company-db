# Company Management System

This is a University project which uses **linked lists** and **.csv** files to manage a company's employees. It was made as a final project for the course of Computer Programming in C.

It is a command line program, so it is not very user friendly. It was made to test the knowledge of the C language and the use of linked lists.

## Features

- Add, edit and remove employees
- Search for employees
- Batch delete employees
- Test the program with a sample database
- Works with **.csv** files
